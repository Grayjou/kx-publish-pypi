# Unified Publisher Configuration
# Copy this file to publish_config.toml and customize for your project

[publish]
# Target repository: "test" for TestPyPI, "prod" for PyPI
target = "test"

# Whether to require confirmation before publishing
confirm = true

# Clean build artifacts (dist/, build/, *.egg-info) before building
clean = true

[package]
# Path to the package root (where pyproject.toml is located)
path = "."

# Patterns to exclude from packaging (optional)
# These are just informational - actual exclusions should be in pyproject.toml
exclude = [
    "tests",
    "docs",
    ".git",
    "__pycache__",
]

[tokens]
# SECURITY WARNING: It's recommended to use environment variables or system keyring
# instead of storing tokens in config files. Only use these for local development.
#
# Priority order for token resolution:
# 1. Environment variables: TESTPYPI_TOKEN or PYPI_TOKEN
# 2. System keyring (via kx-publish-pypi setup-tokens)
# 3. These config values (NOT RECOMMENDED for shared configs)
#
# To use environment variables:
#   export TESTPYPI_TOKEN="pypi-xxxxx..."
#   export PYPI_TOKEN="pypi-xxxxx..."
#
# To use system keyring:
#   kx-publish-pypi setup-tokens
#
# Uncomment only for local development (NEVER commit tokens to version control):
# test = "pypi-..."
# prod = "pypi-..."
